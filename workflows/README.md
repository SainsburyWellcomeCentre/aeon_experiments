# Hardware Tests

This branch contains workflows for self-contained testing of different components in the Aeon arena:
  - `PatchTest.bonsai`: tests the underground feeder logic, including basic visualizers to check for pellet delivery, threshold-crossing, etc.
  - `RfidTest.bonsai`: tests detection of RFID devices.
