# Workflows

This folder should contain all workflow projects required to run the experiment. It is recommended to keep every project within its own subfolder, and name the subfolder with the same name as the branch name.

Multiple sub-folders are allowed if strict project separation is required, e.g. workflows running on different machines with different environments or incompatible extensions.
