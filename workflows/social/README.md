## Social Foraging

This folder contains the full acquisition workflows for running social foraging experiments in Project Aeon. Setting up, calibration and operational instructions are described below.

## Environment Definition

The environment definition language for social foraging is specified in the `Environment.json` file. If any changes to the language are required, the model classes need to be regenerated by calling `bonsai.sgen` from the `Extensions` folder:

```
dotnet bonsai.sgen --serializer YamlDotNet --serializer NewtonsoftJson --schema Environment.json --namespace Social
```

The resulting class definition files may have to be checked for `$ref` type resolution failures, e.g. `Anonymous` types which can usually be fixed by targeted find-and-replace. These issues are due to be fixed upstream.
